#8 Conclusion

We believe all the pieces are finally in place for a decentralized prediction market for sporting events:

	*	TradeSports has proven the viability of a sports betting platform modeled on a financial exchange.
	*	Bitcoin has spread the notion of a blockchain as a trustless, world-wide, unstop- pable currency.
	*	Ethereum has created a blockchain implementation that allows the distribution of funds according to custom, inviolable rules.

With SportCrypt we have combined our passion for trading sporting events with decades of experience in financial markets and high-efficiency software development.

As market makers, traders, and sports fans, we’ve created the system that we’ve always wished existed, and we’re inviting the world to come join us.
